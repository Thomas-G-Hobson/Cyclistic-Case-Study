# Cyclistic-Case-Study
Once I had completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I was tasked with a Capstone Project.
This Project was to provide insights and put my skills to test. 
The insights were to give the stakeholders a clear understanding of how their company is making its money and how I can help them convert daily riders into annual riders through their subscription packages.
